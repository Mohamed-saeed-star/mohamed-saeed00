</p><p>Over time, the child becomes instinctively adept in perceiving factors that can make him lose control of the bicycle. Just as a child learns the unwritten rules of riding a bicycle through practice, artificial intelligence is developed through repeated simulation.</p>
<h3><font color="blue">1. Supervised Learning</font></h3>
<p>Supervised learning is the most common learning method in the field of artificial intelligence. A machine attempts to derive a function given labeled sets of input and output pairs. When dealing with a numerical data set, regression is used. When dealing with categorical variables, classification is the preferred method. If the model provides an incorrect answer, the model can be adjusted to provide more accurate outputs.</p>
<h3><font color="blue">2. Unsupervised Learning</font></h3>
<p>Unsupervised learning involves a machine transforming data into useful information. Common methods include clustering and association. Clustering groups similar variables together, whereas association detects correlation among variables. Data mining utilizes clustering and association to filter through large data sets. The process of transforming large data sets into meaningful information can be optimized with unsupervised learning.</p>
<h3><font color="blue">3. Reinforcement Learning</font></h3>
<p>In reinforcement learning, a machine autonomously responds to external stimuli and is conditioned through occasional rewards and punishment. The purpose of the reinforcement learning method is to develop a machine that can act rationally on its own.

The large investment bank, J.P Morgan, currently uses reinforcement learning algorithms to place trades. This is accomplished through programming that accordingly awards or penalizes the algorithm depending on the decision made.</p>

<h2><font color="brown">Future Impact of Artificial Intelligence</font></h2>
<p>Rapid advances in artificial intelligence will result in a profound impact on productivity, employment, and competition. However, AIâ€™s future integration into society is a controversial subjec</p>
<h3><font color="blue">Impact on Productivity</font></h3>
<p>Increasing economic productivity leads to more satisfied customers and strengthened corporate profitability. In the airline industry, AI will drive customer satisfaction through accurately scheduled and safer flights. Businesses that harness AI can improve their value proposition to customers while improving profitability at the same time.
