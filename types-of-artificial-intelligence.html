        <h2><font color="brown">What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</font></h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad branch of computer science that is focused on a machine’s capability to produce rational behavior from external inputs. The goal of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence. AI manifests itself in everyday life via virtual assistants, search prediction technology, and even ride-hailing services.</p>

        <h2><font color="brown">Types of Artificial Intelligence</font></h2>
        <h3><font color="blue">1. Reactive Machines</font></h3>
        <p>Reactive machines perceive present external information and plan actions accordingly. The machines perform specialized duties and only understand the task at hand. The machines’ behavior is consistent, given a repeated situation. In the 1990s, IBM developed a reactive machine named Deep Blue to play competitive chess, predicting chess moves by identifying each piece’s board placement.</p>
        <h3><font color="blue">2. Limited Memory</font></h3>
        <p>Limited memory machines can harness recent observations to make informed decisions. The machines consider observational data in reference to their pre-programmed conceptual framework. The observational data is retained for a limited period and then forgotten.</p>
        <h3><font color="blue">3. Theory of Mind</font></h3>
        <p>Theory of mind machines can form thoughts and make decisions in reference to emotional context; thus, they are able to participate in social interaction. The machines are still in the development stage, however, many exhibit aspects of human-like capability. For example, consider voice assistant applications that can comprehend basic speech prompts and commands but cannot hold a conversation.</p>
        <h3><font color="blue">4. Self-Awareness</font></h3>
        <p>Self-awareness machines demonstrate intelligent behavior through ideation, the formation of desires, and understanding their internal states. In 1950, Alan Turing developed the Turing Test to identify machines that could behave indistinguishably from a human being.</p>
        <h2><font color="brown">Artificial Intelligence’s Increasing Relevance</font></h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence’s growing popularity in the 21st century is largely due to the advancements in the sub-field of machine learning. Machine learning develops systems that improve upon themselves, which is accomplished through the identification of algorithms. Some processes that machine learning optimizes include paperwork automation, forensic accounting, and algorithmic trading.</p>
        <h2><font color="brown">How is Machine Learning Achieved?</font></h2>
        <p>The easiest way to understand how a machine becomes intelligent with AI is to compare it to how humans learn. For example, consider a child learning how to ride a bicycle. The child mounts the bicycle, grips the handlebars, and hopes to stay upright and in control. The child does not learn how to ride a bike by understanding the physics of biking, but rather through trial and error.</p>
